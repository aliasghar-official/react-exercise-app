## Introduction

This is a practice project.
I want to add what I learn in this project and future projects.
I did this project with ReactJS.
I used Material UI for style argument and Typescript for type safety and rapidApi platform for api usage.

- **V**itejs: Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **R**eact.js: Frontend library for building the user interface.
